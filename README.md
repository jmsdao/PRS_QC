# What we are doing
- We are following a portion of a tutorial outlined in this paper: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-0353-1.
- The portion we are following is QC of base data.
- We will take a pre-QC data file called `Height.gwas.txt.gz` and perform some QC described by the paper.
- After performing QC, we will check our result against a correctly QC'd file called `Height.QC.gz`.

# Requirements
- Download `Height.gwas.txt.gz` from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RWjk49QNZj9zvJHc9X_wyZ51fdy6xQjv/view?usp=sharing), and move it to the same directory as the notebook `Base_QC.ipynb`.
- Download `post-qc.zip` from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x_G0Gxk9jFMY-PMqwtg6-vdEyUPp5p5u/view), unzip it and move just the file `Height.QC.gz` to the same directory as the notebook `Base_QC.ipynb`.
